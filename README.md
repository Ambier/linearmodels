# Linear Models

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bashtage/linearmodels.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bashtage/linearmodels)


```diff
+ The instrumental variable code is complete and tested
- This package is still under heavy development and should not be considered stable
```

### Plan and status

Should eventually add some useful linear model estimators such as instrumental variable estimators and panel regression. Currently
very unpolished.

* Linear Instrumental variable estimation - *complete*
* Linear Panel model estimation - *incomplete*
* Linear IV Panel model estimation - *not started*
* System regression - *not started*

### Requirements

* Python 3.5+: extensive use of `@` operator
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Pandas
* xarray (optional)
* Statsmodels

### Testing

* py.test

### Documentation

* sphinx
* sphinx_rtd_theme
