Instrumental Variable Estimation
--------------------------------
:ref:`iv-introduction` provides a brief overview of the available IV
estimators. :ref:`iv-module-reference-models` contains a complete reference to
available estimation methods. :ref:`iv-module-reference-results` discusses the
results classes returned after estimating a model as well as model
specification tests. Other components of the models such as covariance
estimators, GMM weighting estimators and the results are presented in
:ref:`iv-module-reference`.

:ref:`Basic Examples <iv/examples/wooldridge-iv-estimation.ipynb>` shows basic usage
through examples from Wooldridge's introductior text book and
:ref:`Advanced Examples <iv/examples/instrumental-variable-estimation.ipynb>` shows more
advanced examples following the examples in Cameron and Trivedi's Stata
introduction.
