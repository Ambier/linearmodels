\subsubsection{Fixed Effect Estimation (PanelOLS)}

\subsubsection{Random Effect Estimation (RandomEffects)}

\subsubsection{Between Estimation (BetweenOLS)}

\noindent Between estimation regresses time averages of the dependent
variable on the time averaged values of the regressors, 
\[
\bar{y}_{i}=\bar{x}_{i}\beta+\bar{\epsilon}_{i}.
\]

\noindent When weights are included, weighted averages are used so
that 
\[
\bar{y}_{i}^{w}=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T}w_{it}y_{it}}{\sum_{t=1}^{T}w_{it}}
\]

\noindent with $\bar{x}_{i}$ similarly defined. Note that if the
conditional variance of $y_{it}\propto w_{it}^{-1}$ then the conditional
variance of $\bar{y}_{i}^{w}\propto\frac{1}{\sum w_{i}}$ and these
weights are used when regressing the weighted averages. Also note
that when $w_{i}=1$ but the panel is imbalanced than the conditional
variance of $\bar{y}_{i}^{w}=\bar{y}_{i}\propto\frac{1}{T_{i}}$.
Re-weighting unbalanced panels is exposed through the fit option \lstinline!reweight!.

\subsubsection{First Difference Estimation (FirstDifferenceOLS)}

\noindent First difference estimation regresses first difference of
the dependent variable on the first difference the regressors, 
\[
\Delta y_{it}=\Delta x_{it}\beta+\Delta\epsilon_{it}.
\]

\noindent When weights are included, weighted are summed to that the
weight on $\Delta y_{it}$ is $\left(w_{it}^{-1}+w_{it-1}^{-1}\right)^{-1}$
which exploits that the conditional variance of $y_{it}\propto w_{it}^{-1}$
and the variance of the difference is the sum of the variances when
observations are conditionally uncorrelated.

\subsubsection{Pooled Model Estimation (PooledOLS)}

The pooled estimator is a standard regression, 
\[
y_{it}=x_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}.
\]

\noindent When weights are included, the data is transformed by multiplying
with the square root of the weights prior to the regression (i.e.,
$y_{it}$ is replaced by $\sqrt{w_{it}}y_{it}$ and $x_{it}$ is similarly
transformed).
